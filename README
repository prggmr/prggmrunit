applications, it has been engineered from the ground up to be incredibly
lightweight, fast, efficent and robust with simplicity and ease of use in
mind.

It is written as a direct extension of the prggmr engine to maximize
performance and is built to serve as a simple to use unit testing framework
and to replace the monolithic unit testing libraries avaliable.

unit tests with NO code modifications required.
